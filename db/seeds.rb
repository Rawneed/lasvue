      	of about 5,171 persons per sq. km. as at 2008. Following this trend, and the fact that Lagos population of 32 African nations combined, the State population is expected to hit the 20 million mark in 2010. At this

      	appropriately referred to as the Ekos. For Ikorodu and Epe Divisions, the local populations are minly Remos and Ijebus with pockets of Eko-Awori settlers along the entire State coastland and riverine areas. However, 
      	despite its Yoruba indigeneity, the State is a global socio-cultural melting pot attracting Nigerians, Africans and foreigners alike. The situation is attributable to its sound economic base, strategic maritime location 
      	and socio-political importanct, which induced a high rate of migration to the State.'},
